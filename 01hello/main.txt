bufio -  Buffering IO is a technique used to temporarily accumulate the results for an IO operation before transmitting it forward.

Buffered input provides several benefits:

1. Efficiency: Reading data in larger chunks instead of individual characters or bytes can improve 
  performance by reducing the overhead associated with frequent I/O operations.

2. Reduced Latency: By reading data in advance and storing it in the buffer, 
  the program can reduce the time spent waiting for the input source to provide data, thereby reducing latency.

3. Improved Throughput: Buffered input allows for more efficient use of system resources, enabling higher data throughput rates.

4. Smoother Interaction: Buffering can improve user interaction by reducing the perceived 
  delay when reading input from slow or remote sources.


example

reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin);

input, err/_ := reader.ReadString();
